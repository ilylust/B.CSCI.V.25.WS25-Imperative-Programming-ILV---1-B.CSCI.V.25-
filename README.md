# Theory part
A || that doesn’t enclose a variable from outside is an anonymous function. Anonymous means “doesn’t have a name.” It works more like a regular function and can be passed into places where a function is required if the signature is the same.

A || that encloses a variable from outside is also anonymous but called a closure. It “encloses” the variables around it to use them.
